/**
 * Architecture Notes:
 * ===================
 * Component - React View Renderer, which must be reusable - this section is intended to
 * go in blogging framework after a stable version with tests, so this should not be
 * intended to be built in process of mix and match, this should be reusable components
 * which can be isolated and can be adapted with style, semantics with SEO and accessibility.
 *
 * Stores / Services - this section should be already prebuilt with api like getAll,
 * createAll and we just call them here from blogging framework and use them for our blog
 * development, but this mostly should be reusable and not a part of renderer in
 * architecture point of view
 * modern patterns for app development like Flux, Redux - should be used and they can also
 * be re-usable if it is possbile but later this
 * content will be separated in a blog prototype
